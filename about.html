                                    Hey! My name is Liene and I love to travel.
                                    I have always felt the calling to travel
                                    North and meet the magnificent mountains
                                    painted by the magical Aurora borealis on
                                    starry winter nights. I also like learning
                                    about other cultures and exploring new
                                    places. I have spent my ERASMUS studies in
                                    the waterfall-rich Iceland, where I fell in
                                    love with the north. Luckily, I was blessed
                                    with a pos-graduate ERASMUS internship,
                                    which gave me a chance to live abroad once
                                    more. I had been in Denmark and my husband
                                    had lived in Finland. Sweden was a country
                                    no-one I knew had ever been. Naturally,
                                    that's where I went.
                                </p>
                                <p class="about-p">
                                    My Swedish story starts on the 15th of
                                    August, when I got accepted as a
                                    communication intern at The Department of
                                    Environment, Ecology and Plant Science
                                    (DEEP) of Stockholm University. After that
                                    there was a lot of work to do: getting all
                                    the documents, finding a place to live,
                                    buying tickets, planning the arrival etc.
                                    Finding a place to live in Stockholm was and
                                    adventure in itself. I had been following a
                                    YouTube channel created by a swede living
                                    there. Lucky for me, he had a video just
                                    about that. Most of the sites he mentioned
                                    where in Swedish. However, with the
                                    reasonably good help of Google Translate, I
                                    managed to get the general idea.

                                    Because of it, it is extremely important and
                                    necessary to share ones experience with

                                    Sweden is part of the geographical area of
                                    Fennoscandia. The climate is in general mild
                                    for its northerly latitude due to
                                    significant maritime influence. In spite of
                                    the high latitude, Sweden often has warm
                                    continental summers, being located in
                                    between the North Atlantic, the Baltic Sea
                                    and the vast Eurasian Russian landmass. The
                                    general climate and environment vary
                                    significantly from the south and north due
                                    to the vast latitudal difference, and much
                                    of Sweden has reliably cold and snowy
                                    winters. Southern Sweden is predominantly
                                    agricultural, while the north is heavily
                                    forested and includes a portion of the
                                    Scandinavian Mountains.
